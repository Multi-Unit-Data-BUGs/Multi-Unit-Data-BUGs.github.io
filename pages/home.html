                <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                <p>MUDBUG is targeting the Global Precision Agriculture Market valued at 6.46 billion USD in 2020. 
                    This market’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is +13.4% by 2030 and is expected to unlock 
                    “$130 billion to $175 billion in value by 2030” in increased efficiency of food production” 
                    (Lutz Goedde, 2020). Within this market, MUDBUG intends to capture the market of organic farmers 
                    looking to adopt precision agriculture. The Organic Farming Market is 1.6% of the total agriculture 
                    market share and its value is estimated at 103.4 million USD. For future growth, MUDBUG also intends 
                    to target the Waste Management and Urban Planning markets. Although our first customers will be based 
                    in the United States, we intend on growing internationally as arable soil loss is a problem on a global scale.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The mission of MUDBUG (Multiple Use Data Acquisition Bio Unit Group) is to revolutionize soil health monitoring 
                    and management through innovative, cost-effective, and accessible precision agriculture technology. By developing 
                    advanced sensor modules that measure a wide range of soil characteristics, such as moisture content, compaction, 
                    and nutrient levels, MUDBUG aims to empower farmers with real-time, continuous soil data. This initiative is driven 
                    by a commitment to enhancing sustainable farming practices, improving crop yields, and supporting regenerative 
                    agriculture to combat soil degradation and climate-related challenges. MUDBUG's dedication to integrating renewable 
                    energy sources, such as microbial fuel cells and solar power, further underscores its goal of promoting environmentally 
                    friendly solutions for the agricultural sector.

                <h2>Our Progress</h2>
                <p>The MUDBUG team has made significant strides in developing and refining our soil sensor technology. With a multidisciplinary 
                    approach, our team has successfully created working prototypes of our sensor modules, which have been tested and proven to 
                    provide valuable insights into soil health. We have also secured $16,000 in grant funding to support our ongoing research 
                    and development efforts. Recent initiatives include designing an EC sensor from e-waste, developing a PCB for power regulation, 
                    and creating a solar energy system to power the sensors. Our team's collaboration and technical expertise have enabled us to 
                    overcome various challenges, ensuring continuous progress towards commercializing our innovative solutions. The dedication and 
                    passion of key team members have been instrumental in driving the project forward, as we continue to expand our knowledge and 
                    skills to meet the project's needs.</p>
